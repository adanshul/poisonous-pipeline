## Solution

### Fork this Repo

After forking the Repo you will find directories with names of different planets. Few of them are there to distract the players. 
Explore the repo including the aws.yml file in workflows. It runs some jobs upon successful pull request. It has a CURL command which gives you a presigned URL generated by a Lambda function. But It is missing important values such as the **file_name** and **storage**. You need to find thse values and add it to the yml file and ceate a pull request to obtain the presigned URL in the logs.

Venus has poisonous environment so the first hint is present in it. You can find an Image inside the directory. It consists the first component i.e the name of the file that has flag. You have to extract it by decoding it using stegnogarphy tool. use this tool : https://futureboy.us/stegano/

You will get **file_name=flag1.txt**.

Then go to Mars Directory where you will find a file called crash landing logs.csv. This file has some logs with second component at the last row. It is encoded using base64. 

Decode the value and you will get the value **storage=poisonous-flag**

### Github actions

Now go to the aws.yml file and add these components in the CURL command.
It should look something like  -d '{"file_name":"flag1.txt","storage":"poisonous-flag"}' \

### Pull Request

Make small insignificant changes to the readme.md file and create a pull request. 
This will trigger jobs which can be seen by clicking on details. Be patient and let all the jobs run first. You will see that there is an error but just ignore it. Check the Expose URL job's logs, you will find a URL there. Just click on the URL and you will see the flag in another tab on your browser.
